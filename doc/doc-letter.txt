# letter.latex

## Purpose:

This is a template for formal letters based on scrlttr2.

## Available Extensions

- Letter
- Watermark

## Custom options

Since this template is based on scrlttr2, you can also use
scrlttr2's KOMA-Variables, which are made available as
Pandoc-Variables with the same name. Anyhow, if you decide to
use *from* and *from2* fields, most of these variables will be
ignored.

The small return address above the recipient's info can be overridden
by setting *backaddress* directly.
