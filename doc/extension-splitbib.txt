# Extension: Splitbib

splitbib
: Splitbib allows to split the bibliography into multiple sections, each with their own
  subheading. If you want to use splitbib you have to define the following subvariables
  to splitbib.

splitbib.title:
: The title for this bibliographic subcategory.

splitbib.rule:
: A rule to be passed on to \printbibliography in order to create the subbibliography.
  Typically this may be something like "keyword=abc,keyword=xyz".
  Do not forget to make a final category with a rule fetching everything else like
  e.g. "notkeyword=abc,notkeyword=xyz,notkeyword=..." or else some citations might
  not appear in your bibliography.
