# How to use variables

Variables may be specified inside a YAML-style header in order to customize the output pandoc
generates via some template. Simple variables may be specified as follows:

```
---
author: Max Mustermann
title: Some Document
...
```

If a variable allows for multiple values to be specified (as do bibliography, author or institute,
for example) these multiple values may be specified using the following syntax:

```
---
bibliography:
  - books.bib
  - journals.bib
...
```

There are also instances where subvariables are used. These are referred to as variable.subvariable
in this reference guide (e.g. append.title or append.file) and may be specified as:

```
---
append:
  - title: The pandoc man pages as pdf
    file:  pandoc.pdf
  - title: Why to use markdown
    file:  why-markdown.pdf
...
```
