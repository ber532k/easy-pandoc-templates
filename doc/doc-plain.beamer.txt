# plain.beamer

This template is a slightly modified version of pandoc's
default.beamer. Everything that's available in default.beamer should
work with this template as well.

## Custom Variables

slidenumbers
: Number slides (pretty much like you would pages).
Value: true or empty [true| ].

titleblock
: Instead of the default title slide, print a custom slide containing
title, possibly a subtitle and the block of text specified as
titleblock. This is useful if you have quite specific ideas about what
information needs to be included on the title slide.
