### Bibliography

bibliography
: Use the following biblatex files to resolve citation keys.

  subheading. If you want to use splitbib you have to define the following subvariables
  to splitbib.

splitbib.title:
: The title for this bibliographic subcategory.

splitbib.rule:
: A rule to be passed on to \printbibliography in order to create the subbibliography.
  Typically this may be something like "keyword=abc,keyword=xyz".
  Do not forget to make a final category with a rule fetching everything else like
  e.g. "notkeyword=abc,notkeyword=xyz,notkeyword=..." or else some citations might
  not appear in your bibliography.

  If this is not set, this appendix will not show up in any of these lists.

  If empty, the title will be used as a label.

append.pages
: Only use the following pages  from the given pdf.
  e.g. "1", "1-4", "1,2,6,7", "5-last", "4-1"
