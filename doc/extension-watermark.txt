# Extension: Watermark

watermark
: If set, the specified text will be inserted as a watermark on every page.
E. g. ``watermark: Draft`` will print "Draft" as watermark.
This somewhat conflicts with titlepage and appendix however, since the Watermark will not be in the background for these title- or appended pages.
